Foldable Layout
=================
This code is a showcase of a foldable animation I created for Worldline. The code is fully written
with java APIs from the Android SDK, without the use of any external library. This code is a demo and lot a library.
The foldable layout is a layout (strictly a RelativeLayout), which can have two child layouts, one for the cover, and
one for the details. The foldable layout take care of the folding animation between those two layouts.
 
In the demo the foldable layout is use in a RecyclerView, to show that it can manage well its size even during animation.


Is a library available ?
========================
This code will not become a library. This code is too much specific (even if it is working from a separate gradle module).
This is a showcase, and if you want to use it, I greatly recommend you to understand the code from the `foldablelayout` and adapt it
to you your usage.
